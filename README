## Makefile.PL

    * Module::install used by PEP
    * both Moo and Dancer2 uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    * i pick one without knowledge about the differences

any idea on it ?

## To Moo qw() or to Moo =>

while declaring the attributes, i get the habit to
always declare 'required' and 'is' in a qw()

    has qw( owner is rw required 1 )
    , isa => Str;

instead of the more classic

    has owner  =>
    , is       => 'rw'
    , required => 1
    , isa      => Str;

David complained on it as it scares the newbies.
I'm not sure about it. Any thought to share ?

## use autodie by default ?

autodie dies everytime something's wrong with `$!`.
i would like to use it as default because:

### pros

* developers often forget to test, autodie don't
* autodie probably does the job the way you would do.
* less infrastructure code gets more readable code
* you can avoid it when you want to die your way

    { no autodie;
        open my $fh,'>','/etc/sympa.conf'
            or die $SYMPA::EightBall; }

### cons

* if we want to step back, it will ask an audit to
  spot where autodie made the job well

  maybe we should have a way to localize autodie ? like

  sub autodie (&@) {
        use autodie;
        my $cb = shift;
        map $cb->(), @_;
  }
